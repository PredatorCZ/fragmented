<toolset_description># Fragmented

Fragmented is a merge hell for spike modules that are too simple to have their own toolset project, or common modules across multiple projects.

This project runs on Spike foundation.

Head to this **[Wiki](https://github.com/PredatorCZ/Spike/wiki/Spike)** for more information on how to effectively use it.
